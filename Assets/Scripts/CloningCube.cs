        /* IDEA FOR SYNC THE CUBE:
         * 
         * Currently, I'm able to instantiate the cube on network for all players and
         * setup the parent, with PunRPC. But, the problem is that is setting incorrect
         * parent! As implemented in AmbientSetup.cs, the playerHand is actually the
         * local player hand, and setting the parent to playerHand forces to every
         * player set the cube parent to it's hand!!
         * 
         * That's NOT what I want. I want to set the cube parent to the player that
         * actually click the cube. For this, I might have a solution, that consists on
         * redo what I was first trying to do:
         * 
         * -> Change playerHand to be a list of GameObject, and the index is players
         * index on network. The problem with that is that I have to figure out how to
         * get player's GameObject from PhotonNetwork. Once I can do that, I should be
         * to create that list and setup cube's parent correctly.
         * 
         * UPDATE:
         * 
         * Now this works perfectly fine!
